# Ultron

Ultron is a lightweight template for building Python-based services or command-line applications. This repository intentionally starts with a minimal structure so that you can grow it into whatever you need. Below you'll find documentation on how to get started developing, running locally, and deploying your application.

## What’s Included

This repository includes the following components out of the box:

- **`main.py`** – A simple entry point script that prints a greeting. Replace this with your own application code.
- **`requirements.txt`** – A list of Python dependencies. Add any packages your project requires here so that they’re installed automatically when you build or deploy.
- **`deployment/`** – Deployment tooling including a Dockerfile and a README with build/run instructions. Use this folder if you wish to containerise your application.
- **`.gitignore`** – Standard git ignore rules for Python to keep compiled files and caches out of version control.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Create a virtual environment and install the Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application**

   Execute the entry point script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   You should see the message `Hello from Ultron!` printed to the console. You can modify `main.py` to perform whatever functionality your application requires.

3. **Add Your Code**

   Replace the contents of `main.py` with your own logic. Add new modules and packages as necessary, and don’t forget to update `requirements.txt` when adding third‑party dependencies.

## Development Tips

- **Use virtual environments** to isolate dependencies.
- **Write unit tests** and consider integrating a continuous integration (CI) workflow (e.g. GitHub Actions) to automatically run tests when you push changes.
- **Document your code** and usage patterns in this README so that others can understand your project quickly.
- **Keep your deployment files up to date.** If you add dependencies or change the entry point, make sure `Dockerfile` and the deployment instructions reflect those changes.

## Docker Deployment

If you would like to run your application inside a Docker container, follow the instructions in `deployment/README.md`. The provided `Dockerfile` will install dependencies from `requirements.txt` and run `main.py` by default. After modifying `main.py` or `requirements.txt`, rebuild the Docker image to ensure your changes are reflected in the container.
